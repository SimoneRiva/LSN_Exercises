Compile with 'make'

Run with './Monte_Carlo_ISING_1D.exe'

Remove .o and executables with 'make clean'

'input.dat' must contain a restart boolean-like integer variable in the first line. If this variable is set to 1 the program will run a simulation starting from the configuration read from 'config.0', otherwise it will generate the starting configuration randomly

By using 'make copy' you can copy the output file 'config.final' into 'config.0' to easily restart

The execution of the program produces the files 'output/output.propertyname.0', containing the block number, block estimation, block average and uncertainty of the property after computing each block.

All output files, including 'config.final' but not 'config.0', can be removed with './clean.sh'

By running './data.exe' (compiled with 'make data') you can append the last two values of each file 'output/output.propertyname.0' to the corresponding file 'data/data.propertyname.dat', so that you can save the final averages and errors after each simulation (e.g. at different temperatures). These file are removed by './cleandata.sh'

The files 'data/metro.propertyname.dat' and 'data/gibbs.propertyname.dat' contain the averages and uncertainties after performing simulations with a total of 2e5 Metropolis and Gibbs steps with nspin=50, J=1.0, h=0.0 (except for magnetization, which is measured with h=0.02) and increasing temp from 0.5 to 2.0 (by 0.1 each time). These are used to produce plots and are not removed by './cleandata.sh'
