Compile with 'make'

Run with './MolDyn_NVE.exe'

Copy the output configurations from previous simulation ('config.final' and 'old.final') into the input for the new one ('config.0' and 'old.0') with 'make copy'

Clean everything with './clean.sh'

Before starting a simulation make sure that the first line in file 'input.dat' contains either 0 (if you want the simulation to take in input only the actual configuration 'config.0' and set random starting velocities) or 1 (if you want to restart the simulation taking in input also the old configuration 'old.0'). In the latter case the second line must contain 1 if you want to rescale velocities, otherwise it can contain anything else.

The files in the directory 'measures' named 'output_propertyname_10_phasename.dat' contain the results of measures over 10 simulations, each of 4000 steps, with the input data for each phase. Their plots show how after that time the thermodynamic quantities are equilibrated at the beginning of the simulations. They are not removed by './clean.sh'

The files 'ave_propertyname_phasename.out' in the directory 'averages' contain the averages and their uncertainties obtained from simulations of 50000 steps divided in 100 blocks. They are not removed by './clean.sh' either
