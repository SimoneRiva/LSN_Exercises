Compile with 'make'

Execute with './TSP.exe'

Remove .o files and the executable with 'make clean'

Remove output files with './clean.sh'

From 'TSP.h' the number of individuals and the number of iterations can be modified

Choose whether to place the cities on a circumference or inside a square by commenting the complementary lines of code in the function Initialize

The program produces two output files: 'best_path.out' contains the cities coordinates in the sequence given by the best path found, 'length.out' contains the length of the best path and the average of the best half of the population at each iteration

The '_circumference.out' and '_square.out' files are used to produce the graphs and are not removed by './clean.sh'
