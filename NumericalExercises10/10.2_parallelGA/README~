Compile with 'make'

Run with 'mpiexec -np n_nodes ./TSP.exe'

Remove .o files and the executable with 'make clean'

Remove the output files (but the ones used for the plots in the notebook) with './clean.sh'

From 'TSP.h' the number of individuals and the number of iterations can be modified

Choose whether to place the cities on a circumference or inside a square by commenting the complementary lines of code in the function Initialize

The program produces two output files per node: 'best_path_noderank.out' contains the cities coordinates in the sequence given by the best path found, 'length_noderank.out' contains the length of the best path and the average of the best half of the population at each iteration
